# Online Collaboration ERD System
We design an online collaboration platform which is a collaborative learning environment used to integrate different knowledge (Entity-relationship model, ERD) from other team members. Through communicating with team members and observing other's idea, we hope this platform can accelerate knowledge integration and promote learning efficiency.
