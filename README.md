# Collaborative ER diagram Learning System
We design Collaborative ER diagram Learning System which is a collaborative learning environment used to integrate different knowledge (Entity-relationship model, ERD) from other team members. Through communicating with team members and observing other's idea, we hope this system can accelerate knowledge integration and promote learning efficiency.

## Develop tools and techniques
+ Html5, css
+ Javascript
+ Xampp, Nodejs(socket.io)
+ Php, Mysql

## In practice
+ Taught ER diagram to 77 students and recorded participant learning behaviors by the collaborative learning system
for further analysis
